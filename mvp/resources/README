You can find out more about Galasa on the Galasa website https://galasa.dev, or you can host the website locally by 
running the `docs.jar` file that is contained in this zip file on your machine or on an internal server.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                    
Running the Galasa website locally                                                                                                                    
-----------------------------------                                                                                                                         
                                     
You can run the `docs.jar` file locally by using the standard java command with the -jar option. 

Running the website on your local machine
-------------------------------------------

From a command line, run the following command in the directory into which you extracted the `docs.jar` file: 

`java -jar docs.jar`

The URL to view the locally hosted documentation is returned: http://localhost:9080/


Running the Galasa website on an internal server
----------------------------------------------------
 
To host the website on an internal server so that it can be accessed by other users, set the host 
system properties or environment variables to bind to an externally available network interface, 
rather than localhost. For example: 

`java -Dserver.http.port=12345 -jar docs.jar` or `SERVER_HTTP_HOST=example.com java -jar docs.jar`
